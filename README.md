This is a repository that as the time consists of three projects and one folder with products from CAD course exercises:
- An arduino based accelerometer setup and two python scripts for reading the recorded binary data.
  This project was aimed to provide some acceleration data with low cost to assist coaching my swimmers.
- A python program for reading swimming statistics files (.csv) from Tempus that I did for a task in the beginner course of python.
  This folder also contains a .csv for testing purposes
- A video rig for filming swimmers at hervanta swimming pool.
  This project is old so some files were lost but the construct is simple enough to recover similar design in the future
- Folder of files from the CAD course excersises made with SOLIDWORKS.
