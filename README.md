This is a repository that as the time consists of two projects:
- An arduino based accelerometer setup and two python scripts for reading the recorded binary data.
  This project was aimed to provide some acceleration data with low cost to assist coaching my swimmers.
- A python program for reading swimming statistics files (.csv) from Tempus that I did for a task in the beginner course of python.
  This folder also contains a .csv for testing purposes
